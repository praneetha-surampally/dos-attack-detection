# dos-attack-detection
Machine Learning-based Detection System for DoS Attacks using Logistic Regression, KNN, and Decision Tree.

🚨 Cyber Threat Detection for DoS Attacks
This project uses Machine Learning to detect Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks using the SDN dataset.
It compares models like Logistic Regression , K-Nearest Neighbors, and Decision Tree , and visualizes results in an interactive Streamlit app.

📌 Features
Preprocesses network data from SDN Dataset
Trains multiple ML models
Shows accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report
Identifies source IPs of DoS attacks
Interactive login system

🧠 Tech Used
Python
Streamlit
scikit-learn
Pandas
Matplotlib

🗃️ Dataset
